An ""unlocked"" device is no longer locked to Sprint Prepaid services and the user may attempt to activate it on another carrier's network. There are generally two scenarios for locking/unlocking:
Domestic SIM Unlocking (""DSU""): A device may be referred to as 'locked' if that device was manufactured with programming restrictions that prevent another carrier's SIM card from being inserted into the SIM slot for use on a different network.  Generally, most smartphones launched after February 2015 are DSU-capable  meaning the SIM slot can be unlocked for potential usage on other carriers in the United States. Even if unlocked, Sprint DSU-capable devices may not work on another carrier's network. Whether an unlocked Sprint device can be used on another carrier's network is subject to that carrier's policies and network compatibilities. MSL Unlocking: A device is 'locked' if it is manufactured with a type of disabling software and a locking code (referred to as 'Master Subsidy Lock' or 'MSL'). Generally, MSL locks were utilized on devices launched before February 2015.  Sprint can provide the MSL code to eligible customers, however this does not mean that the device will be able to be successfully used on any other carrier domestically. Whether another carrier will accept and activate a device on its network is subject to that carrier's policies and compatibilities.",general,,

120,no_device,[],[],[],[],Sprint airave,FAQs for the Sprint AIRAVE,FAQs for the Sprint AIRAVE,"What is the Sprint AIRAVE and how does it work?
The Sprint AIRAVE is a personal base station that provides enhanced voice and 3G mobile broadband coverage for your Sprint CDMA devices (phones, hotspots, tablets and modems). The AIRAVE uses your broadband Internet connection to route calls to the Sprint Nationwide Network.
Does the Sprint AIRAVE support 3G data?
Yes. The AIRAVE provides enhanced coverage for any 3G Sprint phone or mobile broadband card at EVDO Rev. A data speeds of up to 3 Mbps downstream and 1.5 Mbps upstream. The AIRAVEs transmission speed is only as fast as your maximum broadband connection speed. Internet congestion, the number of users on your providers network and other factors can decrease your actual speed.
What wireless devices work with the AIRAVE?
The AIRAVE is compatible with any Sprint CDMA device. The AIRAVE also supports Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile prepaid services.
Does the AIRAVE support Sprint Direct Connect?
Yes, Sprint Direct Connect (SDC) services that operate on the Sprint network are supported on the AIRAVE.
How many simultaneous users can use the AIRAVE?
The AIRAVE supports up to six simultaneous active wireless voice calls, data sessions or combination of both. Up to 50 mobile devices can be associated to the AIRAVE.
Can I use all my normal mobile phone functions such as voicemail and text messaging with the AIRAVE?
Yes, with the AIRAVE you can use the same voice functions and text messaging that you use with your Sprint phone.
What is the range of the AIRAVE?
The AIRAVE covers up to 5,000 square feet. Actual coverage range is dependent upon many factors, including building construction type.
Will a Sprint phone automatically detect the AIRAVE?
Yes, once you move within range of the AIRAVE, your Sprint phone will automatically detect the AIRAVE.
How do the customers know if they are within the AIRAVE coverage area and making calls on the AIRAVE?
A short double tone on your wireless phone before making and receiving calls indicates you are within range of the AIRAVE. In addition, you can dial *99 on your wireless phone and a prerecorded message will confirm that you are within the AIRAVE coverage area.
Does the AIRAVE have an impact on the handsets or battery life?
Battery life is improved over the AIRAVE because of the increased signal strength it provides. The stronger the signal, the less power the mobile device needs to communicate to the AIRAVE.
What does a customer need to get started?
 An AIRAVE device
 High-speed Internet access  cable/DSL/FT1/T1 (satellite is not an acceptable option)
 An available power outlet (110 VAC)
 A physical location that is within close proximity of a window for GPS signal acquisition and within AIRAVE coverage areas; for details, please visit sprint.com/airavecoverage
Does the AIRAVE work with satellite broadband?
The AIRAVE does not work with satellite broadband service because of too much jitter and delay, and the inability of some satellite broadband services to support IPSec.
What happens if I have a power or Internet service provider outage?
Your AIRAVE will not work during a power outage or ISP outage. In the event of an outage, your wireless phone will automatically try to obtain service directly from the Sprint network if coverage is available.
What is the recommended broadband bandwidth for the AIRAVE?
Individual bandwidth needs vary per customer. Sprint recommends a minimum of 800 Kbps (both upstream and downstream) for voice services and 3 Mbps downstream and 1.8 Mbps upstream for data services. The following table shows recommended bandwidth by usage type:

Does the AIRAVE work in basements?
For optimal coverage, the AIRAVE should be centrally located at an elevated position within your home or office. However, the AIRAVE will operate anywhere within your location provided that broadband Internet access is available and that the unit is within close proximity of a window for GPS signal acquisition. In the instance that a GPS signal cannot be obtained, an external 30-foot GPS antenna is included that can be situated near a window.
How should I connect the AIRAVE to my home network?
To ensure the best voice and data quality, connect your AIRAVE directly to your broadband modem or other broadband connection device. If you have additional equipment, such as a computer or wireless router, it should be connected through one of the two LAN ports on the back of the AIRAVE. For more information on installation, refer to the Technical and Troubleshooting Guide or User Guide on the sprint.com/airave website.
How do I know that my AIRAVE is operating correctly?
The LEDs on the front of the AIRAVE indicate how the device is operating. Under normal circumstances, the broadband, GPS, network and mobile LEDs will be solid green. For more information on LED operation or troubleshooting, refer to the Technical and Troubleshooting Guide.
Can I use my high-speed modem to access the Internet and talk on the phone at the same time?
Yes, you can use your high-speed Internet connection while using the AIRAVE. Use of your modem will not compromise the ability to make or receive calls on your wireless handset.
Why does the AIRAVE require Global Positioning System (GPS) technology?
The AIRAVE uses GPS for network synchronization and 911 device location information.
Can customers call 911 with my AIRAVE service?
Yes, 911 service works with the AIRAVE. However, 911 service will not be available during a power outage, an ISP failure or software device updates, and it may be limited because of some public safety answering points not supporting location-based E911 technology. Always be prepared to report your location to the 911 operator when placing an emergency call. Mobile phones operate using radio signals, which cannot guarantee connection in all conditions.
Do wireless calls initiated on the AIRAVE continue once the user leaves the AIRAVE coverage area?
Calls that originate on the AIRAVE will automatically try to transfer to the Sprint network if a strong signal is available. Transfer is not guaranteed depending on network availability, signal strength and interference.
Does a wireless call that starts outside of the AIRAVE coverage area transfer to the AIRAVE when the user enters the coverage area?
No. Calls that are initiated on the Sprint network will continue there, even though you may be within the AIRAVE coverage area.
Is the AIRAVE device portable?
The AIRAVE is available in specific areas within the United States. To check whether the area you are traveling to supports AIRAVE, visit sprint.com/airavecoverage. Note: Your AIRAVE will not work if you take it into non-AIRAVE coverage areas.
Does the AIRAVE work outside of the United States?
No. The AIRAVE is supported only in the continental United States, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Alaska is not supported. Please refer to sprint.com/airavecoverage for location availability.
Do specific ports need to be enabled on the customers router for the AIRAVE to work?
Installation of the AIRAVE should be simple plug and play. AIRAVE uses standard ports to connect to the Sprint network via the Internet. If your AIRAVE cannot connect to the Sprint network because of a unique network configuration, you may need to open the following UDP ports on your switch, router or firewall that the AIRAVE access point is connected to: 53, 67, 68, 500 and 4500. Contact your broadband Internet provider, router manufacturer or network administrator for detailed instructions on how to open ports on your equipment.
Does the AIRAVE support dynamic and static IP addressing?
Yes, the AIRAVE can support dynamic and static IP addressing. For instructions on how to select and configure static IP, please refer to the AIRAVE User Guide.
Can we use multiple AIRAVE devices within the same area (e.g. same strip mall, apartment or office building)?
Multiple AIRAVE devices can be deployed in the same general area (apartment complexes, strip malls etc.) without issue. In this scenario, the AIRAVEs will not interfere with one another, but they will not work together. For example, an active call will not transfer from one AIRAVE to the other. Therefore, multiple AIRAVEs should not be in close proximity or used as a single solution to address large buildings.
Are calls and data usage secure while using the AIRAVE?
Wireless traffic between the mobile device and the AIRAVE uses CDMA encoding, as is the case on the Sprint network. Traffic that is routed over the Internet, between the AIRAVE device and Sprints core network, uses IPSec with 3DES encryption.
Does the AIRAVE use licensed or unlicensed spectrum?
For wireless traffic, the AIRAVE uses Sprints licensed 1900 MHz CDMA spectrum, providing better performance, less interference and better in-building RF penetration compared with other solutions that use unlicensed Wi-Fi spectrum and higher frequencies.
Does the optional AIRAVE unlimited voice plan include incoming and outgoing calls?
Yes, all domestic outgoing and any incoming voice calls that are made on the AIRAVE are included in the optional AIRAVE unlimited voice plan. Data use is not included as part of this optional unlimited plan, but you will still benefit from the enhanced coverage and performance. Sprint standard pricing and service restrictions apply.
Does the unlimited voice plan include international calling?
International calls are not included as part of the AIRAVE unlimited voice plan but can be placed at standard international calling rates. Sprint standard pricing and service restrictions apply.
How many minutes are included with the AIRAVE?
No minutes are included. The AIRAVE uses whatever minutes are in your wireless plan. In most cases, that is unlimited.
Are there any safety concerns when using the AIRAVE?
The AIRAVE meets all applicable FCC standards and has a maximum RF power output of 10 mW or 10 dBm. In comparison, a Linksys WRT54G Wi-Fi router has an RF power output of 63.1 mW or 18 dBm.
Can other Sprint customers use the AIRAVE?
All Sprint customers with a Sprint mobile device can use the AIRAVE and benefit from the enhanced coverage as long as you have not restricted the AIRAVE.
Can customers limit access to their AIRAVE?
Yes, you can limit access to your AIRAVE device by creating a list of up to 50 approved Sprint phone numbers (a.k.a. Whitelist). You can create your list on sprint.com by logging into your Sprint account and selecting I want to update my AIRAVE within the My Device and Media tab. You also may call AIRAVE Customer Support at 866-556-7310. Once a change is made to the Whitelist, a reboot is needed for the changes to go into effect on the AIRAVE device.
Under what circumstances should customers restrict their AIRAVE?
Although you can limit access to your AIRAVE, restriction would be needed only in the rare circumstance that other Sprint users are taking up capacity on your device. Because in most cases a user would have to be inside your home or office to acquire AIRAVE capacity, restricting the device could mean restricting any guests or colleagues that are within your home or office.
Does restricting the AIRAVE provide additional security?
No, restricting your AIRAVE does not provide additional security. Whether in open or restricted mode, security is provided via standard CDMA encoding for the portion of the traffic between your handsets and the AIRAVE, and IPSec/3DES encryption for the portion of the traffic that is routed over your broadband Internet connection (between the AIRAVE and Sprints core network).
Is there a phone number or website to get more information about the AIRAVE?
Yes. You can visit sprint.com/airave for more information about the product functionality and availability, or call Sprint Customer Service at 888-211-4727.
How can customers receive product support?
Product support and documentation are available online or through Sprint Customer Service:
